This will begin authentication with Rdio. Once authentication is complete, the page should refresh and you should see what's currently playing on Rdio as a confirmation that the Rdio authentication was a success.\r\n\r\nYou can select a default playlist to which you can add tracks and albums. Click save to store the setting.\r\n\r\nDuring browsing, you should now see a new context menu titled Search Rdio for... upon selecting some text and right-clicking. This menu has three child menus, Artist, Album, and Track. When one is selected, the extension will launch a small pop-up window with the top five results returned by Rdio. You are able to Play, Queue, Add to Playlist, and Add to Collection directly from this popup.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nPerforming an Artist search, finds the first resulting artist for your search and then returns that artist's top 5 tracks.\r\n\r\nCurrently, if you directly play a track and close the popup, the track will stop playing. Will try to change this behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
